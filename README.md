Liar's Dice – Python Game with AI Opponent

This project is a Python implementation of Liar's Dice, a classic bluffing game. The game allows a player to compete against an AI opponent in a battle of probability, strategy, and deception.

Features:
✅ Turn-based gameplay – Players take turns making bids or calling "Liar."
✅ AI opponent with smart decision-making – The AI analyzes probabilities, adapts its strategy, and occasionally bluffs.
✅ Dynamic rounds – Each round involves rolling dice, placing bids, and challenging opponents.
✅ Balanced difficulty – The AI makes strategic moves, making the game challenging but fair.

The goal is to outsmart the AI by making accurate bids or catching its bluffs before running out of dice.
